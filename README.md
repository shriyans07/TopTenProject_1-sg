# TopTenProject_1-sg
I created a list of the top 10 best characters in Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul (based on my opinions)
The text of the banner turns red when hovered upon.
Each individual letter of the title of this list turns dark gold when hovered upon. (in case your bored)
Each character on the list have three components:
- The name turns dark gold when hovered upon, and links to the biography of the character.
- The image of the character decreases in opacity when hovered upon, and links to a great moment of the character.
- There is a basic description of the character.
The footer of the website says "By Shriyans Ghosh", with the most amount of periodic table elements possible.
