                <p class="place-p">
                We first saw Tuco as an energetic psycho who ruled the drug market in Albuquerque. In one instance, he beat one of his men to death for making a statement that nobody else would've cared about. Tuco's pscyhotic behavior was the reason for his early death however. When holding a weapon to Jesse, he is tricked, and gets a rock smashed on his head. 
                <br><br>
                Eventually, he was shot to death by Hank. Tuco left a mental scar on Jesse and Walt, and it took them a while before they decided to cook again. Tuco's never before seen energetic rage differed from his Salamanca cousins who preferred a colder and silent approach.

                At the start of Better Call Saul, Nacho was a member of the Salamanca cartel, and was Tuco's right hand man. However, he was the one who got Tuco in jail, as he plotted with Mike Ehrmantraut to have Tuco pull a gun on him, right when the cops showed up. Nacho took over Tuco's place, and worked under Hector Salamanca.
                <br><br>
                Nacho was the one who put Hector in his iconic wheelchair, when he swapped Hector's heart pills with sugar pills. His last dance was when he let several assailants into Lalo's house which led to the death of many of Lalo's family. Before he was executed, Nacho revealed his burning hatred for the Salamancas and all his acts of sabotage against them. Instead of being shot by Juan Bolsa, Nacho get's out of his confinement, and holds Bolsa hostage. But Nacho decided he had done everything he needed to do, and ended up killing himself. As just one person, Nacho did the most damage to the Salamancas besides Gustavo Fring.</p>

                For the majority of both shows, Hector was confined to his iconic wheelchair. He only communicated with his bell, in which a ring signified "Yes". However, before he was crippled, Hector was a terrifying character. He had no patience and would do whatever it took to get what he wanted.
                <br><br>
                Hector's greatest enemy was Gus, and before Hector died, he took Gus with him. Hector plotted with Walter White to set up a bomb onto his wheelchair. Before Gus gave Hector a lethal injection, the bomb went off, killing Hector, Gus, and Tyrus.

                We were introduced to Lalo towards the end of Better Call Saul. However, despite his short screen-time, Lalo left a traumatic mark on several characters, most notably, Saul Goodman. Lalo came to Albuquerque after Hector became crippled. Lalo immediately became the Gus's most dangerous rival.
                <br><br>
                Lalo used his deadly smile to create a fall sense of comfort for his opponents. However, behind his smile, he was ruthless and killed anyone in his way, the Salamanca way. When his house was invaded by several assailants, Lalo was single-handedly able to kill ever single one. His death only came against the cold blooded Gus, in a duel. Despite his short appearance, Lalo's character was able to impact many characters severely.

                Mike was the private investigator and head of security for Gus. Despite his old age, Mike was extremeley intelligent and very capable. If it were not for Gus stopping him, Mike would've killed the Salamancas and Hector.
                <br><br>
                Even though he was cold-blooded, Mike had a heart and even when Gus ordered the execution for some people, Mike punished them less severeley. Mike's soft spot was his personal life and he was very close to his grand-daughter.

                <p class="place-p">
                At the start of Breaking Bad, Jesse was a low-life drug dealer, who wasn't making enough money, and indulged in partying and drugs. He soon started cooking meth with Walter White, his former Chemistry teacher, and the two rarely got along. Jesse was too soft, and frequently made mistakes, going back to his old ways. <br><br>

                However, events such as his girlfriend, Jane's death, and him killing an innocent person named Gale, led to a shocking change to Jesse. From being loud and energetic, Jesse became more silent and lethal. He had more turmoil with his partner Walt, but also improved his chemistry knowledge, becoming one of the top meth cooks.

                <p class="place-p">
                Hank, a DEA agent, was also the brother-in-law of Walter White. Hank was a loud and boastful man, with an energetic sense of humor, and was several times a comic-relief in the show. However, that didn't mean that he wasn't strong. When two of the deadliest Salamanca assailants attacked Hank, he was able to kill both of them. <br><br>

                Hank wasn't all brawn though, he was also very clever, and was the only one who suspected Gus as being a drug lord. Hank was also able to unmask Heisenberg, finding out that it was his own brother-in-law. His brain and brawn made him the most dangerous DEA agent to the cartel.

                <p class="place-p">
                Gus Fring, probably the most dangerous and smartest drug lord that Walter White ever faced, was a complete mastermind. He tricked everyone into believing that he was the generous owner of "Los Pollos Hermanos", while he was at the head of the biggest drug route north of the border. <br><br>

                He was able to take down Don Eladio, and basically destroyed the cartel. Gus was also very elequent, in everything he did. Even when he died, he went out in a very "formal" way by tucking in his tie.

                <p class="place-p">
                Saul was the lawyer of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. He was charismatic and the most hilarious character on the show, making frequent humorous remarks. Saul was the likeable comic-relief and could talk his way out of absolutely everything. <br><br>

                He was also the main character in Better Call Saul. This show showed Saul's backstory, when he was known as Jimmy McGill, started his stormy journey in law. In this show, Saul was a lot more emotional, and we learned that he had a brother who died, and a loving wife who had later left him. All this pain likely showed that behind the humor of Saul Goodman, was a hurting man.

                <p class="place-p">
                Walter White started out Breaking Bad as an overqualified high school Chemistry teacher. When he was diagnosed with Lung Cancer, in order to leave behind money for his family when he died, Walt became a meth cook, working for Tuco Salamanca, and then later, Gustavo Fring. His superiorly pure "blue meth" led to him being the most wanted meth cook, who was just known under the pseudonym "Heisenberg". <br><br>

                Soon, his cover fell off, and this broke his bonds with the people close to him. He became a more dangerous man day by day, killing Gustavo, Hector, and Mike. He became the most powerful man in the cartel, growing out his empire into a massive territory. His greed sprialed out of control, and his ties with everyone close to him broke off. Heisenberg eventually was considered the villain of his own show,
